Project Overview
This repository contains two intermediate-level Python projects: a Weather App Using API and a Number Guessing Game with GUI. These projects are designed to help developers improve their skills in handling APIs, GUI development, and error management.


Project 3: Weather App Using API

Description
Build a weather app that fetches real-time data using APIs! This project teaches you how to handle APIs, parse JSON data, and manage errors.

Features
Fetches real-time weather data from OpenWeatherMap API
Parses JSON data and extracts relevant information
Handles errors and exceptions for robustness

Code Structure
The weather app code is structured into the following sections:
weather_app.py: Contains the main weather app logic
api_handler.py: Defines the API handling functions
weather_data.py: Parses and extracts weather data

Example Usage
$ python weather_app.py
Enter city name: London
Current weather: Sunny, 22Â°C


Project 4: Number Guessing Game with GUI

Description
Create a fun and interactive number guessing game using Tkinter! This project helps you develop essential skills in GUI development, random number generation, conditionals, and user interaction.

Features
Generates a random number for the user to guess
Creates a GUI with input field, buttons, and labels
Handles user input and provides feedback

Code Structure
The number guessing game code is structured into the following sections:
number_guessing_game.py: Contains the main game logic
gui.py: Defines the GUI components and layout
game_logic.py: Handles user input and provides feedback

Example Usage
$ python number_guessing_game.py
Guess a number between 1 and 10:

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Tkinter for GUI development
OpenWeatherMap API for weather data
